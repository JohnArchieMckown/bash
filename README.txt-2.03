This directory contains the bash package for z/OS 
It is included as part of the additional material with 
the redbook. "Open Source Software for z/OS and OS/390 
UNIX", SG24-5944-01.  Once the tar file is unwound,
see the package contents for license information, main 
README, etc. 

It might help to first read the chapter "bash" in the book.
If you don't have the book it should be on the Web starting at:
http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/sg245944.html

You can install the package yourself or to use the install file 
in this directory.  The syntax is:

  bash.install tar_file install_dir

  where: tar_file is bash-2.03-mvs.tar.gz, and
         /usr/local is the recommended install_dir 

Also, there is an install script for all packages associated 
with this redbook that should be ../5944-01.install.  
See chapter 3 of the book, "What is on the CD". 

Besides the source code, binaries are also provided if you
don't have a C/C++ compiler or just don't want to build them.
The binary tar file bash.bin.pax.Z was built on OS/390 V2R9.
You unwind it with "pax -rzf" and /usr/local is recommended.
The following files are in the archive bash.bin.pax.Z:
bin/
bin/bash
man/
man/C/
man/C/cat1/
man/C/cat1/bash.1
man/C/cat5/
man/C/cat7/
man/C/cat8/
